# Calcubaker
This app allows you to convert between different units of measurement used for cooking, without losing important precision when converting between weight (e.g. grams) and volume (e.g. cups). In order to do so correctly, the substance its density has to be taken into account so I've tried to provide the data for some of the most common ingredients.

# Support
I don't actively maintain this because it only does one simple thing and it (attempts to) does it right. If you have any ingredients or metrics you'd like me to add, I'd be happy to do so.
